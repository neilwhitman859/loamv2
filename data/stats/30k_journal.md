# 30K Plan Journal

Append-only. Every session adds an entry. This is the detailed narrative — what was attempted, what worked, what broke, what surprised us. Different from the session log in the plan (which is a summary table). This is institutional memory.

### Planning Session — 2026-04-08

**What happened:** Full strategic planning session. Evolved from a López de Heredia producer scrape walkthrough into a fundamental rethink of the entire data approach.

**Key realizations:**
- The existing 518K wines are 93% garbage. 170K empty shells. Junk producers. Mangled names.
- LWIN isn't as clean as assumed — 1K dedup groups, 14% have no wine name, 37% missing appellation, zero cross-links to COLA.
- Every attempt to fix data in place made things worse (17 rounds of follow-ups, inference revert disaster).
- The wine `name` field conflates cuvée, producer, appellation, grape, and vintage into one string.
- Wine identity varies fundamentally by country — France is appellation-driven, US is varietal-driven, etc.

**What was decided:**
- Build from scratch. Archive existing data. Target 20-25K quality wines.
- Three-metric grading: confirmation, completeness, enrichment.
- AI suggests, sources confirm. Nothing enters canonical on AI confidence alone.
- Price-tier coverage targets: $30-100 is the core (100%).
- Iterative batch approach: Batch 0 prototype (50 producers), then scale.
- 4 sessions planned in detail, rest decided after Batch 0.
- Josh Test as the real-world benchmark.
- Provenance on every data point.
- Display name as computed column, country-aware.
- NV only for actual NV. Blend percentages require source confirmation.
- Varietal name in wine name = source-confirmed grape (label regulation rule).

**Surprises:**
- The "30K LWIN wines with commercial signal" cohort is a natural ~30K group.
- TTB Wine Producer Permit list exists as a free CSV (17,940 US wineries) — we had TTB COLA but never the permit registry.
- Wikidata has CC0 wine producer data with GPS, founding year, websites.

**What to watch for:**
- LWIN licensing — verify commercial use is allowed.
- Cuvée cleaning is the hardest unsolved problem.
- Session continuity is the biggest human risk.
- The suggest+confirm model might limit completeness if too few staging sources confirm Haiku's suggestions.

**Numbers:** 0 new wines, 0 new producers. This was a planning session.
