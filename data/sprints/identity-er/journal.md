# Sprint 7: Producer Identity ER — journal

**Opened:** 2026-04-21
**Status:** Active
**Current block:** Session 10.1 launched the sprint, named the new method
`identity_dossier_select_v1`, and shifted the live roadmap away from Sprint 6's
pairwise producer-dedup continuation.

## Block log

- **Session 10.1 (2026-04-21):** launched Sprint 7 as the new active producer
  identity effort.

  **Scope held:** no implementation of dossier builders, no benchmark reruns,
  no queue-building, no merge execution, and no human-review workflow.

  **Decisions locked at launch:**
  - no human pair review at scale
  - fixed budget
  - AI-only escalation allowed only on a narrow frontier
  - abstention is better than a false merge
  - the new live method name is `identity_dossier_select_v1` ("Identity
    Dossier Select")

  **Why the sprint exists:** Sprint 6 proved the pairwise merge-only framing is
  useful as benchmark context but not trustworthy enough as the live path.
  Sprint 7 therefore starts from reusable producer dossiers, shortlist
  selection, explicit relationship typing, and accepted-edge-first merging.
